# RC Car with STM32 ARM Microcontroller

![RC Car](rc_car_image.jpeg)

## Overview

Welcome to the RC Car project repository! This project showcases the development of a remote-controlled car using an STM32 ARM microcontroller and modern C++ programming techniques. This repository serves as a hub for all the hardware design, software code, and documentation related to building your own RC car.

## Features

- **STM32 ARM Microcontroller**: We utilize the powerful STM32 microcontroller to control and manage various aspects of the RC car, ensuring smooth and efficient operation.

- **Modern C++ Programming**: The software for this project is written in modern C++ to make the codebase clean, maintainable, and efficient.

- **Remote Control**: You can control the RC car remotely using a dedicated controller or via a smartphone application, providing a seamless and intuitive user experience.

- **Real-time Feedback**: The car is equipped with sensors to provide real-time feedback on its speed, direction, and environmental conditions.

- **Customizable**: The project is highly customizable, allowing you to add features, sensors, and accessories to suit your preferences.

## Repository Contents

- **Hardware Design**: Find detailed schematics, PCB layouts, and component lists for building the physical RC car.

- **Firmware**: The C++ codebase for the STM32 microcontroller is organized in this section. It includes drivers, control algorithms, and communication protocols.

- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation on how to set up the hardware, flash the firmware, and control the RC car.

- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides and tutorials to help you get started with building and programming your RC car.
